Cucumber-BDD Framework( Behavior Driven Development) based on TDD
  - use gherkin language , where we write test cases 
    first and then we write code.
  - BDD bridges the gap between stakeholders and the
     development team (QAs and developers).
   - In BDD we create feature files and the test cases in these files 
      are written using Gherkin language.
